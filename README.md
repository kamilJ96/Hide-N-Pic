IT Project 2017 Semester 2 Augmented reality mobile app (iOS)

HideNPic

Want to be the best at taking a photo of someone else before they can take a photo of you? Well welcome to HideNPic, an augmented reality game that allows you to do exactly that.

HideNPic is a competition of who can take a photo of the other person first and does it in a cool way. You can see pins in the AR view of your opponent as a guide for you to see where to go. MapView and Chat are other dimensions for you to see where your opponent is and taunt (respectfully) with personal conversation. 

In regards to our repository, Development Apps are the seperate apps we all individually worked on that are not the final product, the final demo can be found in the Final Demo App folder. 

All applications are to be run through Xcode.
